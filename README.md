# Cross-platform Microsoft BotFramework starter written in FSharp using Suave.io with deploy on Azure and Heroku

[![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://azuredeploy.net/)
[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

This site is based on [suave-fshome](https://github.com/tpetricek/suave-fshome) by [@tpetricek](https://github.com/tpetricek) which
in turn is based on [suavebootstrapper](https://github.com/shanselman/suavebootstrapper) by [@shanselman](http://github.com/shanselman). 
It is a small sample that shows how to create a [https://dev.botframework.com](Microsoft BotFramework) bot using [FSharp](http://fsharp.org) 
and [Suave.io](https://suave.io), that can be hosted on both Azure and Heroku.

The FSharp code has been tested on both Windows 10 using the [BotEmulator](https://aka.ms/bf-bc-emulator) and on OSX El Capitan using
[Console BotEmulator](http://aka.ms/bfemulator).

## Getting started Windows

* Get the required components to run [FSharp on Windows](http://fsharp.org/use/windows/) if you don't already have them.
* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/jgoalby/fsharpstarterbot.git`.
* Run build.cmd to install the paket dependencies: `build.cmd`.
* Test the bot with the [BotEmulator](https://aka.ms/bf-bc-emulator).

## Getting started OSX/Linux

* Get required components to run [FSharp on Mac](http://fsharp.org/use/mac) or [FSharp on Linux](http://fsharp.org/use/linux/) if you don't already have them.
* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/jgoalby/fsharpstarterbot.git`.
* Run build.sh to install the paket dependencies: `./build.sh`.
* Test the bot with the [Console BotEmulator](http://aka.ms/bfemulator).
